## 🚀 Get started

Website: visit [pig-game-game.herokuapp.com](https://pig-game-game.herokuapp.com/) to play.

## ✍️ Usage and examples

The idea is that we roll a dice and the active player gets the result value of the dice added to their current score. After that, they can hold the score letting the other player take their turn or try another roll of dice to get the result added to their current score. The thing here is that whenever we roll a one, we lose all our current score and it's then the next player's turn. And so that's why sometimes we need to hold our points.

Every time the players switch turns, their current scores are added to the total score.
